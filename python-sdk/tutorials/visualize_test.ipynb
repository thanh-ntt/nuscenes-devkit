    "## 4. Input Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common in the prediction literature to represent the state of an agent as a tensor containing information about the semantic map (such as the drivable area and walkways), as well the past locations of surrounding agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each paper in the field chooses to represent the input in a slightly different way. For example, [CoverNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10298.pdf) and [MTP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05819.pdf) choose to rasterize the map information and agent locations into a three channel RGB image. But [Rules of the Road](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Hong_Rules_of_the_Road_Predicting_Driving_Behavior_With_a_Convolutional_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) decides to use a \"taller\" tensor with information represented in different channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a module called `input_representation` that is meant to make it easy for you to define your own input representation. In short, you need to define your own `StaticLayerRepresentation`, `AgentRepresentation`, and `Combinator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `StaticLayerRepresentation` controls how the static map information is represented. The `AgentRepresentation` controls how the locations of the agents in the scene are represented. The `Combinator` controls how these two sources of information are combined into a single tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, consult `input_representation/interface.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help get you started, we've provided implementations of input representation used in CoverNet and MTP."
